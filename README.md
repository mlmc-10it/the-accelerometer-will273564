# The accelerometer on a Micro:Bit - Explanation
<dl>
<dt>What is an accelerometer?</dt>
<dd> An accelerometer is a device that measures acceleration, as its name suggests. The accelerometer on a Micro:Bit can measure accelerations of between +2g to -2g. </dd>

<dt>What is a compass?</dt>

<dd> A magnetometer measures magnetic field strength in each of three axes. It can be used to create a digital compass or to explore magnetic fields, such as those generated by a permanent magnet or those around a coil through which a current is running.</dd>

<dt>What is a thermometer?</dt>

<dd> The thermometer on the micro:bit is embedded in one of the chips – and chips get warm when you power them up. Consequently, it doesn’t measure room temperature all that well. The chip that is used to measure temperature can be found on the left hand side of the back of the micro:bit </dd>
